## Improvments

- **Accessibility**: I would have increase the website accessibility (for example images do not use an `image` tag so not really SEO friendly)

- **Better responsive rules**: is the website responsive? Yes. It can be done better :) 

- **Enviroment**: I would have used you starter repo. I started with but I was strugglingly a lot to adapt it to my needs (a react app), most of your rules make sense but others were givining me some extra pain.

- **Reusability**: I would have create more reusable component. Some of them are really specific now.

- **Tests**: I would probably cover services, components and hook with tests (some tests are in place but the time was limited)

- **React-router**: I would maybe include _react-router_ to people cold interact with the application with the back button for example (time was limited and I usually don't like to include extra tecnoplogies and code complexity if is not required)

- **Redux**: I have included redux to show that I'm capable to work with it. Redux add complexity without adding much value to the product (given the current requiremnts). Redux is a good tecnologies but now I tend to use it only when is really necessary and it add a value. From the documentation:
 
> In general, use Redux when you have reasonable amounts of data changing over time, you need a single source of truth, and you find that approaches like keeping everything in a top-level React component's state are no longer sufficient. However, it's also important to understand that using Redux comes with tradeoffs.
